# 🎯 Alternative Solutions - Facebook OAuth Issues

## The Situation

Facebook OAuth is being very restrictive and difficult to set up. This is actually a common issue with Facebook's developer platform - they've made OAuth increasingly difficult for new apps.

## 💡 Reality Check on Facebook

Facebook has become notoriously difficult for OAuth:
- They require extensive app review
- Review can take weeks or get rejected
- Many permissions need business verification
- Even developers struggle with it
- Not worth the hassle for testing/development

**Twitter and LinkedIn are MUCH easier!**
