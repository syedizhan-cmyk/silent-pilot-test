## 💡 Why Account Access Matters

**Without it, I can only guess:**
- "They probably use GPT-4" (but which version?)
- "Maybe DALL-E or Midjourney" (but which one?)
- "Possibly RunwayML for video" (but could be Pika, Synthesia, etc.)

**With it, I can confirm:**
- ✅ Exact AI models and versions
- ✅ API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, etc.)
- ✅ Quality of output
- ✅ Speed of generation
- ✅ Pricing implications
- ✅ Feature completeness
- ✅ UI/UX patterns
- ✅ Exact implementation strategy
