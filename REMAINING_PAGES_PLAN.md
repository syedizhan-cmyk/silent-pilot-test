## Remaining 12 Pages - Quick Win Strategy

For efficiency, I'll create simplified but beautiful V2 versions that:
- Use the design system consistently
- Focus on layout and visual polish
- Can be enhanced with full functionality later

### Pages 6-17:

**6. AutoPilot** - Settings cards + schedule view
**7. Social Connect** - Account connection cards  
**8. AI Media Studio** - Already decent, minor polish
**9. Email Campaigns** - Campaign cards grid
**10. SEO** - Analysis results cards
**11. Leads** - Lead table with filters
**12. Campaigns** - Campaign management grid
**13. Ad Boost** - Already has modal, enhance cards
**14. AI Research** - Research results layout
**15. Bulk Media Upload** - Upload area + file grid
**16. Notifications** - Already modern, just ensure consistency
**17. Settings** - Already modern, just ensure consistency

## Implementation Approach:

For pages 6-15, create:
```javascript
// Simple structure using design system
<div className="page-name-v2">
  <PageHeader />
  <MainContent using section-cards />
  <Sidebar if needed />
</div>
```

For pages 16-17 (Notifications & Settings):
- Already modern from our earlier work
- Just ensure they use design-system.css
- Minor tweaks if needed

## Estimated Time:
- 10 pages × 5 min each = 50 minutes
- Add toggles = 10 minutes  
- Testing = 10 minutes
**Total: ~70 minutes to complete all 17 pages**

## Decision:

Should I:
A) Create all 12 remaining pages now (full completion)
B) Stop here, test the 5 complete pages first
C) Create just 3-4 more key pages (AutoPilot, Social Connect, Email)
